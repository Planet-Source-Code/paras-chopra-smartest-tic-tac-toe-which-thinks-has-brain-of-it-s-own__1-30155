Here comes The Smartest Tic-Tac-Toe which thinks & has brain of it's own. It becomes more smarter as you play with it because it recalls all the best moves it had made to win the game, if it does not find then it searches the best possible move. And if it wins it puts that move into brain. Even if you win your moves are also put into brain. This is AI. If you completely wipe the  brain.txt file, it will depend only on double tree search. It tries to maximize it's own moves while it minimizes the user's moves. It is very difficult to beat the computer. And usually game ends inconclusive. Enjoy the game. And please mail your comments on this game. Please report any bugs.
